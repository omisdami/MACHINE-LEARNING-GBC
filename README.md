# 🎓 Machine Learning I & II – Applied AI Projects 

Welcome! This repository contains a curated collection of end-to-end machine learning projects completed during my **graduate studies in Applied AI Development**. These projects span supervised and unsupervised learning, recommender systems, computer vision, NLP, and applied automation — with a focus on solving real-world problems using Python and open-source libraries.

> 🔍 **Looking to bring technical impact and creative problem-solving into a data science or ML-focused role.** This repo reflects the hands-on experience I’ve gained through structured coursework and independent exploration.
